# to-do-list-styling

## Description:
In this project, I have created a simple todo list in React. You can add new items to the to do list and remove items by clicking the "done" button. I also added some basic styling to make it easier to read (see the css file for details).

## How to Run:
Fork this repo to your own, clone it to your local machine, run the project in your local server by running "http-server -c-1" in the local folder.

## Future development:
I'd like to improve the todo list by:
1) adding a checkbox before the todo items
2) moving the completed tasks to a category below
3) re-adding the todo items back if accidentally checked off
